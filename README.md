# Bit-Clicker
This is an infinite clicker app made by myself and Kadin Pegram for my application development class.

# Objective
Users click a button to gain experience points in order to level up.  Users may purchase upgrades to increase the rate at which one gains experience in return leveling the user up faster.  The goal is to become the highest level with the highest level being infinity.  

# Libraries and Methods Used
Android studio was the IDE used to create the mobile application.  We utilized Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, View Model, SQLITE/Room Database, Navigation, Hilt, and Intent.
